**Module 2 — Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)**

## 🌟 Introduction — The Architecture of Never Trusting Anything

Zero Trust is not a product.  
Zero Trust is not a firewall.  
Zero Trust is not MFA.  

Zero Trust is a **continuous decision-making engine** spread across identity, devices, networks, workloads, and data.

A true Zero Trust Reference Architecture must:

- Continuously verify  
- Enforce least privilege  
- Assume breach  
- Decay session trust over time  
- Apply conditions before *and* during access  
- Govern movement between clouds  

This blueprint shows how **StageCloud unifies AWS, Azure, and GCP** into one consistent Zero Trust framework.

# 🧭 1. Zero Trust Master Principles

Every design decision in this architecture derives from three fundamentals:

### **1️⃣ Verify explicitly**  
Every authentication & authorization must evaluate:

- Identity strength  
- Device posture  
- Location  
- Risk level  
- Session context  

### **2️⃣ Use least privilege**  
Access must be:

- Scoped  
- Time-bound  
- Contextual  
- Continuously reviewed  

### **3️⃣ Assume breach**  
We design as if:

- Credentials may be compromised  
- Networks may be untrusted  
- Devices may be infected  

This mindset shapes the entire StageCloud Control Plane.

# 🧩 3. Identity Fabric (The First Perimeter)

### **Azure Entra ID**
- Primary identity authority  
- MFA enforcement  
- Conditional Access  
- Identity Protection  
- Token lifetime control  
- Device trust integration  

### **AWS IAM Identity Center**
- Federated authentication  
- Session policies  
- Permission sets  
- SCIM lifecycle automation  

### **GCP IAM / BeyondCorp**
- Context-Aware Access  
- Device trust  
- Service boundaries  

**Identity is the root of trust in every Zero Trust decision.**

---

# 💻 4. Device Trust (The Second Perimeter)

Device identity determines whether access should be:

- Allowed  
- Blocked  
- Downgraded  
- Elevated (MFA, re-authentication)  

### **Azure Intune**
- Compliance enforcement  
- Jailbreak/root detection  
- OS patch level  
- Encryption status  
- Malware posture  

### **AWS**
No native device trust — must inherit Entra trust.

### **GCP**
Strongest device identity posture (ChromeOS, BeyondCorp levels).

---

# 🌐 5. Zero Trust Network Architecture (ZTNA Layer)

Traditional networks gave **implicit trust** to “internal” traffic.  
Zero Trust eliminates this entirely.

### **AWS Network ZT**
- Security Groups (microsegmentation)  
- VPC Endpoints (private-only access)  
- Transit Gateway zoning  
- No inbound SSH/RDP (SSM Session Manager only)  
- WAF + Shield  

### **Azure Network ZT**
- NSGs  
- Private Links  
- Azure Firewall  
- Conditional routing  

### **GCP Network ZT**
- VPC Service Controls (best-in-class)  
- Access Levels (identity-aware routing)  

**Principle:**  
There is no trusted network—only trusted *requests*.

---

# 🔐 6. Workload Identity Mesh (Service-to-Service Trust)

Workloads authenticate the same way humans do:

### **AWS**
- IAM Roles  
- Short-lived STS credentials  
- No static credentials  

### **Azure**
- Managed Identities  
- App Registrations  

### **GCP**
- Workload Identity Federation  
- IAM Conditions  

This creates:

- API Zero Trust  
- East-west workload isolation  
- Fine-grained access  

---

# 📊 7. Data Trust Layer (The Final Boundary)

Data classifications determine access.

### **AWS**
- IAM fine-grained access  
- KMS boundaries  
- Tag-based access control  
- Macie detection  

### **Azure**
- Purview  
- Sensitivity labels  

### **GCP**
- VPC Service Controls (restricted egress)  

**If data isn’t protected, Zero Trust is incomplete.**

---

# 🌀 8. Zero Trust Continuous Verification Loop

Real Zero Trust *never stops evaluating*.

Each cloud continuously verifies:

### **Identity**
- Risk  
- Behavior analytics  
- Impossible travel  
- Token anomalies  

### **Device**
- Compliance  
- Malware  
- OS security  

### **Network**
- Suspicious IPs  
- Unexpected routing  

### **Workload**
- GuardDuty  
- Azure Defender  
- Google SCC  

### **Data**
- Exfiltration  
- Privilege escalation patterns  

Zero Trust is a **living system** — not a one-time configuration.

# 🧨 10. Why This Architecture Wins Real Interviews

Every cloud-security interview asks:

- “Explain Zero Trust across AWS, Azure, GCP.”  
- “How do you enforce identity-based Zero Trust?”  
- “How do workloads trust each other?”  
- “How do you prevent lateral movement?”  
- “What does Zero Trust look like at enterprise scale?”

This blueprint is engineered to answer all of them — with clarity and architecture.
