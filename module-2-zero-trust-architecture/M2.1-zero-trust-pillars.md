# 📄 M2.1 — Zero Trust Pillars (CISA / NIST)  
**Module 2 — Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)**  
**SecureTheCloud Academy — Multi-Cloud Control Plane**

---

## 🧩 Introduction

Zero Trust is built on globally accepted frameworks defined by:

- **NIST SP 800-207 — Zero Trust Architecture**  
- **CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model**  

Together, these form the structural foundation every Zero Trust program is measured against.

# 🔱 The Six Pillars of Zero Trust

---

## **1️⃣ Identity Pillar — “WHO is making the request?”**

Identity is the *foundational* pillar of Zero Trust.

Includes:

- Strong identity provider (**Entra ID**)  
- **MFA** enforcement everywhere  
- **Conditional Access** policies  
- **SCIM-based lifecycle automation**  
- **JIT (Just-In-Time)** role elevation  
- **Privileged Identity Management**  
- **SAML + OIDC federation**  

Identity becomes the **new perimeter**, replacing the traditional network boundary.

---

## **2️⃣ Device Pillar — “WHAT is the request coming from?”**

Zero Trust requires full device posture awareness:

- Device compliance  
- OS integrity and patch status  
- MDM/Intune enrollment  
- Jailbreak/root detection  
- Real-time device risk scoring  

If the device is **untrusted**, Zero Trust blocks or limits access.

---

## **3️⃣ Network Pillar — “WHERE is the request coming from?”**

Traditional networks trusted the internal LAN.

Zero Trust eliminates *all implicit trust*.

Controls include:

- Micro-segmentation  
- Strict inbound/outbound rules  
- Private connectivity enforcement  
- IP allowlisting & geolocation filters  
- No-public access patterns  
- Network-based anomaly detection  

Every packet must prove trust.

---

## **4️⃣ Application / Workload Pillar — “WHAT is the workload doing?”**

Workloads must authenticate and authorize *everything*:

- User → Application  
- Application → Application  
- Application → Cloud API  

Zero Trust workloads:

- Use **identity-based access (IAM roles)**  
- Do **not** use static credentials  
- Rotate credentials automatically  
- Restrict east-west movement  
- Are continuously scanned & patched  

Workloads can no longer assume internal trust.

---

## **5️⃣ Data Pillar — “WHAT are you trying to access?”**

Zero Trust enforces continuous data control:

- Data classification  
- Encryption (at-rest + in-transit)  
- Tokenization & masking  
- DLP enforcement  
- Context-aware data access  
- Tag-driven permissions (AWS)  
- Attribute-based access control (**ABAC**)  

Even if identity is valid, **data access must still be justified**.

---

## **6️⃣ Automation & Observability Pillar — “HOW is trust continuously verified?”**

Zero Trust is *dynamic* — not a one-time check.

This pillar includes:

- **GuardDuty**, **CloudTrail**, **Security Hub**  
- **Azure Identity Protection**  
- **Sentinel SIEM** correlation  
- **GCP SCC (Security Command Center)**  
- Automated remediation (Lambda, Logic Apps, Cloud Functions)  
- Risk-based adaptive access  
- Session revocation  
- Continuous trust evaluation  

Continuous verification = **true Zero Trust**.

# ⭐ Conclusion

These six pillars form the **skeleton** of Zero Trust maturity.

Next, you will learn:

- How **AWS**, **Azure**, and **GCP** each implement these pillars  
- Why each provider’s Zero Trust model is different  
- How **SecureTheCloud** unifies all three into a **single Multi-Cloud Control Plane**

You now understand the framework — next, you will build the architecture.
