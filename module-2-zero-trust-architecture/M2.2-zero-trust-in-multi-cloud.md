## 🌍 Introduction — The Challenge of Multi-Cloud Zero Trust

Zero Trust becomes exponentially more complex when applied to **multi-cloud architectures**.

Each cloud provider:

- Has different security primitives  
- Uses different enforcement layers  
- Implements identity and device trust differently  
- Handles session verification differently  
- Provides different telemetry and anomaly detection  

Yet your organization must enforce **ONE unified Zero Trust strategy** across **AWS, Azure, and GCP**.

This module explains:

- How each cloud implements Zero Trust  
- Where they align  
- Where they differ  
- How the SecureTheCloud Control Plane unifies them

# 🧱 Understanding Multi-Cloud Zero Trust

Multi-cloud Zero Trust must answer four questions:

1. **Who is the identity?** (Identity Pillar)  
2. **What is the device?** (Device Pillar)  
3. **What resource is being accessed?** (Workload/Data Pillars)  
4. **Where is the connection from?** (Network Pillar)  

The challenge:  
Each cloud evaluates these differently.

- Authorization models do not match 1-to-1  
- Session risk scoring varies  
- Trust boundaries shift depending on the service  
- Enforcement layers differ  

To build a **single Zero Trust strategy**, you must understand **each cloud’s trust engine**.

# 🔷 Zero Trust in Azure (Entra ID + Conditional Access)

Azure’s ZT architecture is the **most identity-centric** of the three major clouds.

### **Azure Key Enforcers**
- Conditional Access (CA) Policies  
- Identity Protection (risk-based decisions)  
- Intune Device Compliance  
- Privileged Identity Management (PIM)  
- Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE)  

Azure evaluates:

- User identity  
- Device health  
- Location & IP  
- Real-time identity risk  
- Token & session lifetime  
- Application sensitivity  

### **Azure Strengths**
- Strongest identity & device posture enforcement  
- Best enterprise integration  

### **Azure Weaknesses**
- VNet segmentation is weaker than AWS  
- RBAC is less granular than AWS IAM  

---

# 🔶 Zero Trust in AWS (IAM + SCPs + Session Policies)

AWS Zero Trust is **resource-centric and identity-enforced**, driven by:

- IAM Policies  
- IAM Roles  
- STS Session Policies  
- Service Control Policies (SCPs)  
- VPC Security Groups  
- WAF & Shield  
- GuardDuty  
- CloudTrail continuous validation  

AWS **does not** provide built-in device trust.  
Instead, it relies on:

- Entra Conditional Access  
- MFA enforcement  
- Session duration policies  

### **AWS Strengths**
- Most granular authorization model (**IAM**)  
- Strongest network segmentation (**SGs, NACLs, TGW**)  
- Best workload identity model (**roles-only patterns**)  

### **AWS Weaknesses**
- No native device posture  
- Depends on external IdP for SSO trust evaluation  

---

# 🔷 Zero Trust in Google Cloud (BeyondCorp)

GCP pioneered Zero Trust with **BeyondCorp**.

### **Key GCP Components**
- BeyondCorp Enterprise  
- Context-Aware Access  
- IAM Conditions  
- VPC Service Controls (strongest network ZT in the industry)  
- Organization Policies  

GCP evaluates:

- Device trust  
- User identity  
- Network context  
- Application risk  
- Private service perimeter  

### **GCP Strengths**
- Best Zero Trust network enforcement (**Service Controls**)  
- Strongest device trust model (ChromeOS / Android integration)  

### **GCP Weaknesses**
- IAM is flexible but less granular than AWS  
- Policies require deep expertise

# ⚖️ Comparing Zero Trust Across Clouds

| Zero Trust Pillar | AWS | Azure | GCP |
|-------------------|------|--------|------|
| **Identity** | IAM Identity Center + IdP Federation | **Entra ID (strongest)** | Identity + Context-Aware Access |
| **Device Trust** | External MDM only | **Intune + CA (best)** | Native device trust (strongest) |
| **Network Segmentation** | **SGs, NACLs, TGW (best)** | VNets + NSG | **Service Controls (strongest)** |
| **Workload Identity** | **IAM Roles (strongest)** | Managed Identities | Workload Identity Federation |
| **Data Controls** | IAM + KMS | RBAC + Purview | VPC-SC + IAM Conditions |
| **Continuous Evaluation** | GuardDuty + CloudTrail | **CAE + Sentinel** | **Chronicle Security** |

Each cloud excels in different Trust Pillars — none excel in all six.

# 🧠 How StageCloud Unifies Multi-Cloud Zero Trust

The **SC Multi-Cloud Control Plane** **unifies all Zero Trust engines** through a layered architecture:

---

## **Identity Layer**
**Azure Entra ID** provides the unified identity plane:

- MFA  
- Conditional Access  
- Device compliance  
- Risk evaluation  
- Federation into AWS & GCP  
- SCIM lifecycle automation  

This becomes the **global authentication authority**.

---

## **Network Layer**

**AWS** → strongest network segmentation  
**GCP** → strongest private perimeter  
**Azure** → strongest enterprise integration  

STC blends the three:

- AWS segmentation  
- GCP perimeters  
- Azure enterprise rules  

---

## **Workload Layer**

AWS IAM Roles → least-privilege workloads  
GCP Workload Identity → federates with Entra  
Azure Managed Identity → local cloud trust  

---

## **Monitoring Layer**

Correlated visibility across:

- **CloudTrail + GuardDuty + Security Hub**  
- **Entra Sign-In Logs + CA + Identity Protection**  
- **GCP Audit Logs + VPC SC + SCC**  
- **Sentinel + Chronicle + STC Dashboards**  

This becomes a **pan-cloud detection fabric**.
